    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was established in 1978</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">The Saint Thomas Christians, also called Syrian Christians of India, Marthoma Suriyani Nasrani, Malankara Nasrani, or Nasrani Mappila, are an ethno-religious community of Indian Christians in the state of Kerala (Malabar region),[5] who, for the most part, employ the Eastern and Western liturgical rites of Syriac Christianity.[6] They trace their origins to the evangelistic activity of Thomas the Apostle in the 1st century.[7][8] The Saint Thomas Christians had been historically a part of the hierarchy of the Church of the East but are now divided into several different Eastern Catholic, Oriental Orthodox, Protestant, and independent bodies, each with their own liturgies and traditions.[7] They are Malayalis and speak Malayalam. Nasrani or Nazarene is a Syriac term for Christians, who were among the first converts to Christianity in the Near East.

      Historically, this community was organised as the Province of India of the Church of the East by Patriarch Timothy I (780–823 AD) in the eighth century, served by bishops and a local dynastic archdeacon.[6][9][10] In the 14th century, the Church of the East declined due to persecution by Tamerlane,[11][12] and Portuguese colonial overtures to bring St Thomas Christians into the Latin Catholic Church, administered by their Padroado system in the 16th century, lead to the first of several rifts (schisms) in the community.[13][14][15] The attempts of the Portuguese culminated in the Synod of Diamper, formally subjugating them and their whole Archdiocese of Angamaly as a suffragan see to the Archdiocese of Goa, which was under the Portuguese Padroado and celebrated the Roman Rite form of worship. Portuguese oppression provoked a violent resistance among the Thomasine Christians, that took expression in the Coonan Cross Oath protest in 1653. This led to the permanent schism among the Thomas' Christians of India, leading to the formation of Puthenkūr (New allegiance, pronounced Pùttènkūṟ) and Pazhayakūr (Old allegiance, pronounced Paḻayakūṟ) factions.[16] The Pazhayakūr comprise the present day Syro-Malabar Church and Chaldean Syrian Church which continue to employ the original East Syriac Rite (Babylonian Rite /Persian Rite) liturgy.[6][17][18][19] The Puthenkūr group, who resisted the Portuguese, under the leadership of archdeacon Thoma I, organized themselves as the independent Malankara Church,[20] entered into a new communion with the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch, and they inherited the West Syriac Rite from the Syriac Orthodox Church, which employs the Liturgy of Saint James, an ancient rite of the Church of Antioch, replacing the old East Syriac Rite liturgy.[21][22][6]
      
      The Eastern Catholic faction is in full communion with the Holy See in Rome. This includes the aforementioned Syro-Malabar Church as well as the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church, the latter arising from an Oriental Orthodox faction that entered into communion with Rome in 1930 under Bishop Geevarghese Ivanios (d. 1953). As such the Malankara Catholic Church employs the West Syriac liturgy of the Syriac Orthodox Church,[23] while the Syro-Malabar Church employs the East Syriac liturgy of the historic Church of the East.[6]
      
      The Oriental Orthodox faction includes the Malankara Orthodox Syrian Church and the Jacobite Syrian Christian Church, resulting from a split within the Malankara Church in 1912 over whether the church should be autocephalous or rather under the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch.[24] As such, the Malankara Orthodox Church is an autocephalous Oriental Orthodox Church independent of the Patriarch of Antioch,[24] whereas the Malankara Jacobite Syrian Orthodox Church is an integral part of the Syriac Orthodox Church and is headed by the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch.[21]
      
      The Iraq-based Assyrian Church of the East's archdiocese includes the Chaldean Syrian Church based in Thrissur.[25] They were a minority faction within the Syro-Malabar Church, which split off and joined with the Church of the East Bishop during the 1870s. The Assyrian Church is one of the descendant churches of the Church of the East.[26] Thus it forms the continuation of the traditional church of Saint Thomas Christians in India.[27]
      
      Oriental Protestant denominations include the Mar Thoma Syrian Church and the St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India.[28] The Marthoma Syrian Church were a part of the Malankara Church that went through a reformation movement under Abraham Malpan due to influence of British Anglican missionaries in the 1800s. The Mar Thoma Church employs a reformed variant of the liturgical West Syriac Rite.[29][30] The St. Thomas Evangelical Church of India is an evangelical faction that split off from the Marthoma Church in 1961.[31]
      
      CSI Syrian Christians are a minority faction of Malankara Syrian Christians, who joined the Anglican Church in 1836, and eventually became part of the Church of South India in 1947, after Indian independence. The C.S.I. is in full communion with the Mar Thoma Syrian Church.[32][33][34][35] By the 20th century, various Syrian Christians joined Pentecostal and other evangelical denominations like the Kerala Brethren, Indian Pentecostal Church of God, Assemblies of God etc. They are known as Pentecostal Saint Thomas Christians</p>

    <p>Today, Something unexpected happened in my life, Actually It was like a surprise for me, I was completely shocked when I got to know that I’ve won the first prize in my Inter School debate on environmental pollution. It was the second time when I participated in debate competition. At the time when I participated for the very first time so I didn’t secure any position in this competition, At that time I felt a little sad but I decided that I’d do more hard work and I will participate again and I guess that I took the right decision to participate again, Also I learnt that hard work always pays off because At my first participation, I was not concerned towards this competition but when I faced failure then It inspired me to do more hard work and because of that I have gotten this prize, My parents are very proud of me and they have gifted me a cycle for my achievement and now I have known that hard work is most important to achieve success.</p>

      <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">A school meal or school lunch (also known as hot lunch, a school dinner, or school breakfast) is a meal provided to students and sometimes teachers at a school, typically in the middle or beginning of the school day. Countries around the world offer various kinds of school meal programs. Each week day, millions of children from all standards and grades receive meals at their respective schools. School meals in twelve or more countries provide high-energy food with high nutritional values either free or at economical rates.[1]

        The benefits of school meals vary from country to country. While in developed countries the school meal is a source of nutritious meals, in developing countries it is an incentive to send children to school and continue their education. In developing countries, school meals provide food security at times of crisis and help children to become healthy and productive adults, thus helping to break the cycle of poverty and hunger.</p>

    <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Management System</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 colxs-12">In today's competitive world, with increasing working hours and less classroom time, teachers need edTech tools which help them manage precious class time efficiently. Instead of focusing on teaching, faculty members are often stuck with completing formal duties, for e.g. taking daily student attendance.

      Manually taking attendance and registering it in files & musters makes the daily attendance a mundane task for the faculty and unnecessarily consumes classroom time.
      
      To overcome such inefficient work processes, there are various school software systems available to speed up the attendance process and reduce manual work. An online attendance management system or digital attendance platform is one of them, which is developed to automate the daily attendance in schools. Additionally, it helps to maintain accurate records and generate summarized student attendance reports.
      
      What Is Attendance Management System?
      An attendance management system is used by an organization to track staff's time and attendance details. You can save time and effort by calculating your employee's working hours with an accurate attendance management system.
      
      Attendance management system keeps track of daily attendance, working hours, breaks, login, and logout time. It prevents staff's time theft. An attendance management system integrates all attendance devices such as smart cards, biometric, and facial recognition devices in real-time.
      
      MasterSoft's Student attendance management software allows schools of all sizes to manage various attendance requirements. This system makes it easy to create daily attendance reports, absentee lists, letters and other documents almost effortlessly. Student attendance system helps teachers to mark online attendance of students during class & reduce manual work. It is used to track student's attendance, absentee record, attendance history & other related documents. Student attendance software allows you to record & manage daily student attendance to speed up the daily attendance process.
      
      Online attendance management system enables school administrators to record, manage & compile daily student attendance data. Along with student attendance, this software also allows teachers to generate 100% accurate student attendance reports.
      
      What Is The Importance Of An Attendance Management System?
      Without automation, the HR team has to manually deal with the payroll and attendance processes of faculty and administrative staff. The attendance monitoring software helps in tracking employee productivity.
      
      Institutes face compliance concerns, payroll irregularities, and the proxy attendance of students. By replacing the paper-based attendance and timesheets with an automated attendance software, the institute can reduce admin labor, save time and money, and eliminate lengthy attendance processes.
      
      Let us understand the importance of an Attendance Management System with the following functionalities:
      
      Track Performance Of The Staff:
      The software helps the institute to check the overall performance of the faculty as it monitors the check in and check out timing of the employees. The overall working hours further help the HR team to know the overall pay during the payroll process.
      
      Easy Payroll Processing:
      Human error resulting in inaccurate attendance records can cause you to spend more money on overtime payments. The software offers highly accurate results, thus helping to lower the burden of extra payments to employees.
      
      Effectively Calculate The Rate Of Absenteeism:
      The software helps in knowing the employee’s rate of absence, which allows the institute to know when substitute teachers are required to fill in for the absent faculty. It also helps in maintaining student discipline as the absenteeism is notified to parents and teachers.
